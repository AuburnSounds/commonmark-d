# Looking for beta-testers

**We are looking for beta-testers** for our next VST/AU plugin, which will be an evolution of [Psypan](/products/Psypan.html).

**What you'll do:**
- Help us test unreleased plugins on your system and DAW,
- Provide feedback about features through email exchanges,
- Suggest things that seem obvious to everyone except the developer :)

That's about it. It's not a big time involvement at all.

**What you'll get:**
- Our next plugin for free
- A mention in the user manual (yes, some people actually read it)


If you are interested send an e-mail to [contact@auburnsounds.com](mailto:contact@auburnsounds.com).
Mention your OS version, DAW(s) of choice, and provide a link to your music.
