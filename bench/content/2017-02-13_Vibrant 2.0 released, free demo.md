## A new game

Vibrant was originally written 14 years ago for MS-DOS. It has received updates since then. But this update goes much further than the previous nine. 

The whole game has been overhauled, adding levels, story-line, multiple game modes, multiple endings, more enemies, tutorial... **Everything changed**, to the point it feels like another game.

We sincerely hope you'll enjoy this new contraption.
