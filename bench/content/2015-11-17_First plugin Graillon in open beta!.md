# This is it!

We are happy to introduce our first new-style plugin, **Graillon**.

After 8 months of intensive work, fear and joy, it has reached a near-completion state.

## This plugin is now in [open beta](../products/Graillon.html).

Available as a VST 2.x for Windows XP+ and Mac OS X 10.6+.

This version features a periodic noise every 30 seconds of processing. This artifact will be removed in the final 1.0 release, available Soon&trade;.
