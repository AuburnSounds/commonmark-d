# Graillon 2: A New Effect For Live Voice Changing

Today Auburn Sounds launches an audio plug-in we are very proud of.

## Previously in version 1

**Graillon 1** (previous version) was mostly about the use of pitch-tracking frequency shifters, applied to voice with fixed ratios.

While funny enough for making growls out of clean voice, it was lacking more applicability.

## The brand new Graillon 2

**Graillon 2** takes this idea and then adds:
- A new mode: Ring Modulation, which is more immediate.
- Clean Pitch-Shifting optimized for voice. We worked hard to keep the latency at about 23 milliseconds, which is only beaten by time-domain pitch-shifting.
- Natural-sounding or obvious Pitch Correction, based upon this Pitch-Shifting.
- also a Bitcrusher.

On use, Graillon 2 is more than the sum of its parts. We hope you will enjoy it as much as we do.

Indeed it's now endless fun to plug it in your host and play with the microphone.

However, if you are interested in pitch-shifting artifacts, Graillon 2 is not just applicable to vocals.
