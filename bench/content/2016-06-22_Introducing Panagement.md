# We are very proud to introduce Panagement!

Panagement is a spatialization multi-effect that is at its core a binaural panner combined with a distance panner.
Then we went to the next level of obsessiveness and added features to make it an easy, inspiring and pristine-sounding stereo processor.

## The inception

Binaural panning was a topic of Auburn Sounds (formerly GFM) with Psypan 4 years ago. Psypan got a tiny underground following and users sent us emails asking for more. We started paying attention.

So we enhanced the basics: inter-aural delay (ITD) and power difference are better tuned.
We added a lower-latency delay interpolation. Finally inter-aural spectral difference which enhance realism and externalization further.
**The result is that Panagement blows Psypan completely out of the water, on its own turf.**

And that's before you turn on the new stuff.

## Going further

We thought it would be useful to add a Tilt Filter, Mono-to-Stereo, and most of all a Distance fader that would put things further. With all the talk about "Depth" lately, what could possibly create depth more directly and in one click?

Our precious beta-testers then asked for a LFO. That turned out to be a very good idea. Panagement in its current form was borned.

While we went a bit mad with the features, the hope is that it all adds up nicely and so far the reviews are very positive.


## Available in Audio Unit

We've implemented Audio Unit support in our new framework. 

**In addition to VST 2.4, Panagement works as a 32-bit and 64-bit Audio Unit**, in both Cocoa and Carbon hosts. 

Panagement can be used for free with the Free Edition, or with all features with the Entreprise Edition.
