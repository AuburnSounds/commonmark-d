# Instant control over your dynamics

Today Auburn Sounds introduces **Couture**, our most refined audio plug-in to date.

**Couture is a two-headed beast: both a Transient Shaper and Saturation processor.**

So what do we mean when we say you can get  _tailored transients_?


## Combined dynamics and saturation

There is often some overlap in usage cases between saturation and dynamics. Both can be used to control peaks. 
Some transients prefer saturation, others prefer dynamics.

**Couture comes with both Transient and Saturation sections** to make related decisions at the same time. 
For example for a drum track you can increase dynamics and smash it later with distortion.


## Full volume-independence

Transient Shaping is traditionally volume-independent. **We extended the Saturation stage to be volume-independent, too.**

When using Couture you keep the freedom to change input gain afterwards.
This avoids some gain-staging dependencies in your signal chain, that may backfire later in the mixing stage.


## Compression versus Transient Shaping?

Our vision is that transient control could perhaps be something _satisfying_.

In general terms, a compressor is **somewhat longer to tune** and **its parameters change volume**: attack, release, ratio, threshold... they change output gain while you tune them.

Essentially, the Transient section of Couture has only 3 parameters and **they have semantic meaning**: 
- **Sharpen**: add or remove dynamics in one click, how "sharp" the signal is
- **Speed**: time scale of captured transients
- **Front vs Back** of the captured note. 

When turned to Front, the Sharpen knob acts like the Attack knob on a regular Transient Shaper. When turned to Front, the Sharpen knob acts more like the Sustain knob on a regular Transient Shaper.

To improve **predictability**, we made Couture's behaviour 100% program-dependent. **Couture catches transients very accurately by design**.

_To make a parallel with photography, Couture could be seen as a_ [Depth of field effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field)_: you can use it to blur some sources in order to emphasize others._


## Introduction Price

The Full Edition of Couture is at 39€ instead of 49€ until September 16th 2018.


## Available now!

Couture is available as an AAX, AU, and VST2 plug-in for your favourite DAW.

The Free Edition removes the saturation modules but has no other time limitation: you can use it forever.
