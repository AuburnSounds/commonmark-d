# What's new in this 1.2 free update?

This version is a maintenance update with bug fixes only. Thanks to everyone who reported the crash in Sierra and helped test the beta version!

**If you are a customer,** you can find the new downloads through the emails sent by Gumroad.

## Bringing macOS Sierra compatibility

Panagement and Graillon 1.2 will now load correctly when instantiated on macOS Sierra.
We are deeply sorry that our plug-ins were among the few that wouldn't work in the new Apple OS. The reason is highly intricate, and will be discussed in a further blog post. Hence why the fix took so long.


## 50% less RAM used

Both Panagement and Graillon will now use 50% less memory than in 1.1. This is actually a byproduct of the Sierra fix and wasn't intended.
