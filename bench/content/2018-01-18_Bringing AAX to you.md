# Bringing AAX to you

Today Auburn Sounds releases Panagement 1.3 and Graillon 2.1.

What's new?

## AAX Native compatibility

**This free update brings AAX Native compability and support in Pro Tools 11 and 12.**

## Graillon shifters polarity

In the Pitch Tracking Modulation panel, you can now invert the polarity of frequency shifters by **right-clicking the sliders**.
This helps achieve a larger number of tones.

When a slider's LED is red, a copy of the original voice is shifted towards lower frequencies instead of the previous behaviour 
(frequency-shifted towards higher frequencies).


## Graillon MIDI input in Cubase and Bitwig

Graillon is now able to receive MIDI input correctly in Steinberg Cubase and Bitwig Studio.


## Panagement first attack

Panagement used to soften the first attack it processes. Not anymore.


## Panagement automation

Changes to Panagement's panorama and LFO shape were not recorded for automation in all hosts. Now they are.


## Support in Vienna Ensemble Pro

You can now use Panagement and Graillon in Vienna Ensemble Pro.
