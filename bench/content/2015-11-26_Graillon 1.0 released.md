# It's a steal!

We're relieved to tell that Graillon can now be purchased through the Gumroad service.

## What is Graillon again?

The general idea was to make an effect singers and producers could enjoy.

Graillon is technically a pitch-tracking poly-Bode-Shifter VST. It creates distorted growl-like vocals from clean vocals and keep consonants untouched. Its most distinctive feature is its low-latency.


## How to get best results with Graillon?

Pitch and voicedness detection can get confused with already processed signals.
The ideal input is a mono singing voice, before any processing, has no reverb, chorus or delay, and has minimal background noise.

## I'm a journalist / blogger, any Press Releases to share?

## I'm a developer, anything open-source?

![dplug logo](images/dplug-logo.png)

Yes. The open-source part of Graillon is called [dplug](https://github.com/p0nce/dplug).

Suscribing is the logical step forward.
